<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is David. I work at Lowes for minimum wage but other than that theres nothing else going on so yeah this page is gonna be pretty empty I guess.</p>
<p>I guess I can talk about school and stuff. I'm a senior, I go to school as required by law, and then I go home and sleep for a couple of hours before doing homework and going back to school.</p>
<p>I'm 18, used to play waterpolo, I play video games in my free time, and yea that's pretty much it.</p>
<p>I learned how to make <font color="#ff8000">this text</font> orange. That's all I got.</p>

<h3>I don't have a picture of myself on hand so look at my dogs.</h3>
