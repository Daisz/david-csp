<h2 style="font-size:120%;"> <u> Data Analysis</u></h2>
<center><b><p>For this project, my partner (Dianne) and I found data online regarding immigration to the United States from Latin American countries in order to create a graph to visualize the data, and how many immigrants different countries produce.</p></b></center>

<div>
    <table width="1000">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="/david-csp/images/chart.PNG" height=400>
            </td>
            <td>
                This is the final graph which was made using data organized in excel. The data was found on the department of homeland security's website, and was already organized for the most part in a form which could be pasted into the table shown below.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>


<div>
    <table width="1000">
        <tr>
            <td>
                The data shown below was originally sorted alphabetically, but we altered the order, and added a column which would hold the total amount of immigrants from each country in the years recorded. The original data is graphed so that the total amount of people who immigrated each year makes up a stack that totals the amount of people who immigranted.

        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<b><center><p>Overall, this project helped me develop a greater undstartanding of how graphs can be made in excel, as well as how easy it is to organized data in excel so that it can be used over again. <br>
This exercise was also helpful by helping me develop an understanding of which graphs should be used for which type of data. </p></center></b>
