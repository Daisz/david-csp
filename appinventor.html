<h2 style="font-size:120%;"> <u> App Inventor- Class Planner</u></h2>

<p>For our project on MIT's app inventor platform, my partner (Andrew Martinez) and I decided to create a homework planning app.<br>
In this app, the user would choose which class they would like to add an assignment to by typing it into a box, then decide upon a date.<br>
When they decide that the assignment has been completed, they could check a checkbox, and then push a button labeled 'Clear Checked Assignments',<br>
making any assignment that is checked clear, as well as removing the applied date tied to that assignment.</p>

<p>In the above photos, you can see the page where the user would choose the class they want to add an assignment to, as well as the layout of the class' assignment page.<br>
The first picture of code whos how each button redirects to another page, and the second picture shows how the checkboxes clear the date labels and textboxes. <br>
A TinyDB was also used to store the values of the labels (ie: DP3_1 would refer to the first datepicker on the third page).<br>
On the far right, it is also shown how the TinyDB stores the value of the textboxes (The picture is cut off, ie: the right side is continued from the left).</p>

<p>The code above also shows how the information stored in the TinyDB is called to fill in the users' last inputs in both the text boxes and date labels when the class' page is opened.<br>
The datepicker also stores its data in the TinyDB after it's value is set by the user.</p>
<p>What I learned while making this app is how I can store data so that a user does not lose their inputs upon closing the app using TinyDB, as well as how to utilize the values of a variable, such as the checkboxes,<br>
to influence the outcome of another process, such as a button being pushed.</p>
