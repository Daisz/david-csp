<h2 style="font-size:120%;"> <u> Python Interactive Story</u></h2>
<a href="https://repl.it/@Daiszz/MemeMasterDiogene" target="_blank"> Diogene The Meme Master</a> 
<br>

<p>For a python project, my partner (Vincent Azpetia) and I wrote a story using Python 3 based on a meme hungry boy in the poor country of Impor (map based on the game 'Papers Please').<br>
In this interactive story, the user would read the text printed, and type in their inputs to make a decision, which would influence the outcome of the story. This style can be compared to 'Choose your own adventure' books.</p>

<p>The code shown above is the introduction which is automatically executed upon running the program, reusulting in the text appearing on the right, followed by the presentation of two choices to the user. <br>
The introduction is called at the bottom of the page, after all of the functions have been defined, making it possible to call functions within functions.

<p>The code above also shows how the two functions tie into one another, resulting in the processing of the user's input, by calling on the function 'leaving(),' at the end of the introducutions strings.  </p>

<p>Overall, the interactive story was very straightforward as the code mainly consisted of strings to be printed. What I learned, was that Python 3 <br>
has a different name for 'raw_input', as it is replaced by just 'input'. I also learned that it is possible to call functions within functions because the entirety of the code is ran by the kernel <br>
before any part of it can be used. Therefore, I could run a function from the bottom of the code, with a function at the top of the code because they have both been defined. I had initially <br>
thought that the code would not work, because the code would be read from top to bottom during use, rather than being fully read before the user called on functions.</p>
