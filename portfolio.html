<br>

<p> In our final project on scratch, my partner and I were tasked with producing a game or story, and we decided to produce a game, where the player would choose a character, and navigate through levels to reach an end goal. In our case, each character was assigned to a difficulty, and would have different stats(ie: different speeds, jump heights, and different movement overall). The player would navigate the levels to get yellow coins for points, and upon beating the game, would be presented with a meme to show that they have beaten the game.</p>

<p> The code shown above is the code used for one character, SpongeGar, and is considered the 'easy' character, due to his larger jump height. The code for movement, as well as the code implemented to trigger a loss, only apply when the character has been picked. This is to prevent the other characters' sprites from interfering with gameplay. </p>
<br>
<p>Overall, I believe that the game works as intended, and only has a few bugs pertaining to the character's interaction with the platforms. The game's creation was a good learning experience, as I believe I learned how to create a game that could have more than one outcome, as well as having multiple ways to play the game. </p>
