<br>
<p>In this project, my partner (Samuel Salazar) and I decided we wanted to define a function which would cut an image, then flip half the image and make that half black and white.</p>

<p> The gifs above show the outcomes of the code after it has been entered in canopy. </p>

<p>Also above you can read the code used in the gifs, and see the original images before they are ran through the code, in the same order as the gifs above.</p>
<p>The code accepts two arguments, one being an image, and the other being an x value within the picture which indicates where the image should be rolled.<br>
The images are then sorted into parts, where part1 is the original right half ot the image, and part2 is the original left part of the image.<br>
Part2 is then flipped upside down and renamed part3, followed by part3 being conveted to a black and white image.<br>
Lastly, the images are pasted together to create a final image, which is them shown on outside of canopy.</p>

<br>

<p>What I learned while coding in this project is how to convert an image to black and white, as well as the importance of keeping track of images as they are edited. <br>
When I was not properly tracking the images, the final photo would be stitched together improperly, or would have both images flipped or both images black and white.</p>
