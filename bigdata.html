             The algorithm makes note of which websites users visit, and what items they view. Using this information, the algorithm can make an informed decision as to what products the user might also be interested in, and those produts are advertised to the user. This data can be categorized under "Volume," since a company like Amazon would have to process massive amounts of data considering how many customers they serve, which all require personalized data in order to help Amazon make more sales.
