<center><b><p>In this project, my partner (Tyler Hit) and I made a preentation on the malware/virus "MyDoom", which infected users thought email and spread itself using information available on the hosts' computers.</p></b></center>

            <td>
                The Software Language used in the MyDoom Worm was mainly C++, and the file types used to apply the malware were mostly .cmd, .exe, /pif, .scr,. zip. 
            </td>
            <td>
                The malware was mainly recieved through spam emails, which contained files claiming to be broken or unsent messages. These files commonly used double file endings to confuse users (ex: (finename).doc.exe). Once opened, te file would apply itself onto the system, while also resending emails to others using the hosts contacts.
            </td>
            <td>
                The virus would begins spreading itself after the email and attachment were opened. The virus would ten be downloaded and would leave a backdoor open in the computer so that the host computer would be more succeptible to other attacks.

                Originated in Russia in late January of 2014, and then spread to North AMerica, where it peaked at one virus per 12 emails and 300,000 computers infected. SCO Group also ofered a $250k reward to find the perpetrator since the creator of the virus planned DDos SCO Group. A month later, MyDoom was programmed to stop spreading, but another verison of MyDoom continued spreading and had an attack planned for Micosoft.com.

                User safety can be insured by not opening the email, as well as any other spam emails he user might recieve from unknown sources. Keepin ativirus software current and updated can also be helpful to protect the user's security. Personal firewalls should also prevent the virus holder from gaining accecss to the computer.

<center><b><p>What I learned while creating this presentation is that there are many ways that viruses can infect users, as well as the impotance of using antivirus software in order to ensure user security. There is also a note to be made as to how users were tricked into opening the virus through double file endings, sa well as how files can be opened with one click.</b></p></center>
