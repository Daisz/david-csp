<br>

<p> In our final project on scratch, my partner (Arturo Martinez) and I were tasked with producing a game or story, and we decided to produce a game where the player would choose a character, and navigate through levels to reach an end goal.<br>
In our case, each character was assigned to a difficulty, and would have different stats(ie: different speeds, jump heights, and different movement overall).<br> 
The player would navigate the levels to get yellow coins for points, and upon beating the game, would be presented with a meme to show that they have beaten the game.<br>
The meme would also vary in quality depending on the difficulty used to beat the game (ie: harder difficulty = better meme).</p>

<br>
<p> The code shown above is the code used for one character, SpongeGar, and is considered the 'easy' character, due to his larger jump height. <br>
The code for movement, as well as the code implemented to trigger a loss, only apply when the character has been picked.
This is to prevent the other characters' sprites from interfering with gameplay. </p>


<p>What I learned while making this game was how to create a new algorithm. In this case it was used to hide sprities or other game assets in a corner,<br> 
so they would not interfere with other objects within the game. I also learned how to create a sort of gravity, where a sprities downward velocity would increase as long as they were not touching a platform. </p>
