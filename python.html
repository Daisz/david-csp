<p> The code shown above shows how I defined rpsls with the variable 'l', as well as how I created a list under the name of 'stuff'. 'Stuff' would be randomized and redefined as 'choice',<br>
to represent the computers choice against the choice of the player in the game of rpsls.</p>
<p>The choice would then be ran against the 'l' variable, which would be the users input, in order to decide upon a winner in rpsls.</p>

<p> The code shown above displays a few outcomes of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, as well as the docstrings in use, which could guide the user if they need help playing the game. </p>

<p>In case the user continues to fail at inputting an acceptable variable, there is a set of strings which will be printed to hopefully guide the user as to how the game should be played.</p>
<p>While writing the code for this project, I learned how to properly define a random variable. Initially, I had been redefining the random variable within the elif statements, resulting in <br>
the users choice being ran against a newly randomized computer choice every time the computer would check for a winner.<br>
Instead, I defined the random choice as a variable, in order to keep it consistent throughout the code each turn.</p>
