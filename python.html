<center><b><p>While writing the code for this project, I learned how to properly define a random variable. Initially, I had been redefining the random variable within the elif statements, resulting in <br>
the users choice being ran against a newly randomized computer choice every time the computer would check for a winner.<br>
Instead, I defined the random choice as a variable, in order to keep it consistent throughout the code each turn.</p></b></center>
