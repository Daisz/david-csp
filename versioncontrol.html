<h2 style="font-size:120%;"> <u>The Importance of Version Control</u></h2>
<center><b>Version control is impotant because it allows users to keep track of the changes they make to their work, while also making sure that revisions and redrafting can be easily done. The benefits of version control allows there to be multiple files with progressive canges which allows users to trace how much they have done, while also making files identifiable in the case where an older version is needed. Versions also allow there to be backups, like if a user updates their website but the update breaks the site. That user still has the previous verison, which is known to work, that they can fall back on. </b></center>
